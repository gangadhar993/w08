I am a new member of the Fall 2018 Batch working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science. 

I'm from India, worked as a Software Developer for 2 years in enterprise mobile application development company. I have experience in developing enterprise mobile applications by using HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript, knockout-js, server-script and java.
